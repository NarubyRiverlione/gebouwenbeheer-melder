# Progress

## What Works

- Express server initialized with SQLite database connectivity.
- TypeScript data models and repository layer for `Report` and `IssueCluster`.
- REST API endpoints:
  - POST `/reports` – create a report
  - GET `/reports` – list all reports
  - GET `/reports/unprocessed` – list only unprocessed reports
  - GET `/reports/countUnprocessed` – get amount of unprocessed reports
  - GET `/reports/query` – filter reports by date, processed, resolved
  - POST `/ingest` – ingest raw email data with validation
  - POST `/reports/process` – find similar unprocessed reports and bundle them in issue clusters
  - GET `/clusters` – list all clusters
  - GET `/clusters/unresolved` – list only unresolved clusters
  - POST `/clusters/:id/resolve` – resolve a cluster and related reports
- Business logic encapsulated in service/repository layers.
- Error-handling middleware and input validation.
- Unit tests for `ReportRepository` and `ClusterRepository`.
- Integration tests for all API endpoints using Supertest.
- GitHub Actions workflows configured for lint, test, and build on Node.js 20.x.
- Memory bank and README updated to reflect current API routes and route configurations.

## What's Left to Build

- Update project documentation:
  - Enhance `README.md` with setup, commands, and API reference.
  - Ensure Memory Bank files reflect current state.
- Final code review and cleanup:
  - Remove any unused code or comments.
  - Verify code style and formatting.
- Plan deployment or further CI (artifact publishing, release generation).

## Current Status

Most core features and tests are complete; CI pipelines are in place. Documentation updates and final review remain.

## Known Issues

- Test pipeline broken due to better-sqlite rebuild issue (low priority)
- All tests pass locally; linting and type checks are green.
